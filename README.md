# Command-Pattern-Undo
Free of use for any purpose.
Current project made on unity version 2020.1.17f1. The basic example of usage of command pattern is when you need to make an Undo-Redo system. In that particular case, I've made a simple character(cube) moving by UI arrows.
The diagram bellow shows the basic principe, how command pattern work.
